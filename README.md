This package detects any unused [es6 style imports](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import)

At the moment it just displays them in the console in a rather unattractive way.

There is ongoing clean up work to be done but the basic idea is down.

Coming up:
  - output as json
  - remove unused imports from source code
